## ðŸ‘€ ABOUT ME
During the last 2 years, I have studied in the Faculty of Information Technology. I've learned a lot about web building, and coding, and actually do it through projects each year. I'm not a very good coding person, but I put in the effort and determination every time I study with it. And besides studying, I also participated in many activities of the faculty. and the university which I am very happy to do.
